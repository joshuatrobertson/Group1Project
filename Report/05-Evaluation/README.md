### Old Idea

#### 1. Sustainadress (*provisional name*) 

In the project we propose Sustainadress, a single page application where the user is tasked with finding the most sustainable outfit of the options provided, sticking within time and budget constraints. This is meant to highlight the environmental impact of fast and unsustainable fashion. We task the user with dressing themselves out of the clothing options provided; after the time limit is up, we reveal whether the user chose the most sustainable outfit overall, out of the options provided. The playful element of this project comes in customizing and dressing up your avatar, and to get a better score on the next playthrough.

### Paper Prototype

- 'old_idea/project 1.pptx' is the prototype we created for our initial idea (Sustainadress).
- 'paper_prorotype.xd' is the prototype for our current idea (Focus on Lock).
- 'prototype_document.docx' is documentation for the current prototype and the thought process behind it.

## Unit Testing
