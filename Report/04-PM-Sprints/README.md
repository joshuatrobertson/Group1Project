# Sprints and Project Management
## Communication

### Communication Channels
Microsoft Teams was the primary tool for our daily standups and we used Discord for our general day to day communication. The Discord server was split into channels to further streamline topics of discussion. The graphic below provides a quick overview of our Discord server.

### Weeks 1 - 5
We used this time to absorb the content delivered in the technical and design workshops and implement the walkthroughs on our own machines. This gave the us the necessary information to decide on which roles we would undertake during our sprints. Therefore, our communication during these five weeks were just limited to the Tuesday and Thursday SEGP timeslots. 

### Weeks 6 - 10
From Week 6 onwards, we held standups on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 10:00 AM. In addition, we used the design and technical workshops on Mondays and Thursdays to further discuss how we would go about integrating the week's material into our repository. 

The [meeting logs](../../Meetings/README.md) provide a top level summary of all of our standups.

## Agile Working
Given the feature driven, modular nature of the project brief, we decided it to adopt the scrum methodology of the agile workflow for our project.

### Step 1: Project Vision and Scoping

Find the results of our scoping workshop and put it in here.

Enter a high level overview and timeline here. Highlight critical points in the project here.

### Step 2: User Story Creation

Show the user stories implemented in each sprint.

| User Story                                                                                          | Sprint                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As a user I want to click on new game to  be able to start and play a new game                      | [Sprint 1](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects/1) |
| As a user I want to click on information so that I can find out about the reasoning for the project | [Sprint 2](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects/3) |
| As a user I want to be able to see the landing page for the website                                 | [Sprint 3](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects/4) |
| As a user I want to be able to see the history of my recent games                                   | [Sprint 4](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects/5) |
| As a user I want to be able to compare my scores against past users of the game                     | [Sprint 5](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects/6) |

### Step 3: Sprint Planning and Execution
Initially, we setup a Jira account account help document our sprints. However, the added overhead was turning out cumbersome and we decided to use GitHub projects to help document our sprints based on the suggestion of Marceli. This is the link to the [sprints](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/projects).

### Step 4: Review and Repeat!




## CI/CD Pipeline
### Git 

### Docker

Talk about how both of these tools streamlined our workflow (maybe with the help of an image?)

## Team Contributions
Discussion of team roles.

Fill this in in a standup.

| Team Member          | Contribution                                                            |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Joshua Robertson     |  |
| Alan Cen             |  |
| Ella Gryf-Lowczowska |  |
| Efan Haynes          |  |
| Keane Fernandes      |  |
