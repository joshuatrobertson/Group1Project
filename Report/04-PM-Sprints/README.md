# Project Management
Team meetings were held three days a week from Week 1 to Week 7. 
## Agile Methodology
Our team decided to adopt a combination of the scrum and kanban methodology for our project. During the scoping on our project, we devised 6 main user stories that were essential to deliver our minumum viable product (MVP).

Weeks 1 to 5 were used to absorb the content delivered in the technical and design workshops. It gave the members the necessary information to decide on their roles in the project.

From Week 6 onwards, we used Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 10:00 AM to hold standups and discuss the current status of our project. This [log](../../Meetings/README.md) provides a top level summary of all of our standups.

In addition, we used the SEGP time slots on Mondays and Thursdays to discuss material relevant to the workshop and think about ways to integrate it into our project.

### User stories

## CI/CD Pipeline

## Team Contributions




Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?) 

Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!). 

Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc) 

Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.
