# Conclusion
## Evaluation
### Working practices
The git workflow was relatively new to all of us which meant that there was a slight learning curve at the start of the project. Merge commits, rebasing and finding our way around git land reduced our development velocity in the initial sprints. However, as the sprints progressed, we gained traction and momentum and code reviews and merges simply became second nature. 

Initially, daily stand-ups and documentation seemed too excessive because we were still finding our way around the technical aspects of implementing our application. However, around the later sprints and documentation, the value of documenting meeting minutes and constant communication became apparent. We had the opportunity to constantly review and refocus depending on the status of the project. Meeting daily definitely helped emulate a working developer environment where we could ask questions and simply update each other on our progress. Moreover, it was useful to look back at the design decisions we made at different stages of the project and to learn from them.

As an aside, given the choice, we would avoid the use of Microsoft Teams for communication due to it being a resource hog and the fact that it almost always caused significant disruptions during our stand-ups. Screen sharing during a video call would simply crash the computer and this would need to be rectified for future work in this project.

### Project Objectives
We had gotten accustomed to the agile workflow by the third sprint, but given the short-lived nature of this project, we managed to achieve the primary objectives required to produce our minimum viable product (MVP). The underestimation of the effort needed to produce coherent and concise documentation meant that we decided not to pursue our secondary objectives of publicly serving our application and implementing user authentication. However, we believe that the current state of our application can act as a solid starting ground for these additional features to be added. 
### Remote Working (COVID)
It has been an unusual year for all of us in this covid stricken era, and it goes without saying that the lack of human interaction throughout the duration of the project has impacted us all. It is difficult to explain using words, but there is this sense of teamwork and spirit that lingers around the room where developers can talk to each other directly when working under the same roof. Anyhow, we believe that our working practices provided us the closest possible resemblance to what developing would be like in a workplace.

## Social / Ethical Implications







### Accessibility

&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated, the crux of our application is a card game with two rounds. The card game itself is not universally accessible, for instance in its current state the game is inaccessible for blind or visually impaired individuals. However, the accessibility of the distractions implemented in the second round of our game is much better by our assessment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **The game itself.** The card game in its current state is inaccessible for visually impaired individuals, as it requires the user to be sighted in order to play. Future work on this application might therefore be to implement narration to describe the game at each state, and a natural language processor that would allow the user to instruct the computer which cards to flip by calling out card coordinates. Adding such features would be a significant step up for us as developers, so other changes are likely to be made first. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **The distractions.** Our application features both auditory and visual distractions in the second round of the game. The auditory distractions - notification sounds, construction work, etc - are inaccessible for deaf or hearing-impaired individuals. However, the visual distractions do not require the user to have any particular level of hearing. Similarly, though the visual distractions may be inaccessible for blind or visually-impaired individuals, if such individuals are not also hearing-impaired then the auditory distractions will be accessible to them.
