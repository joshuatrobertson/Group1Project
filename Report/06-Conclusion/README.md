### Accessibility

&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated, the crux of our application is a card game with two rounds. The accessibiltiy of the card game itself is poor, insofar as the card game in its current state is inaccessible for blind or visually impaired individuals. However, the accessibility of the distractions implemented in the second round of our game is fairly good by our assessment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; **The game itself.** Our card game in its current state is inaccessible for visually impaired individuals, as it requires the user to be sighted in order to play. Future work on this application might therefore be to implement an auditory description of the game at every state. For instance, for each card the user flips, our application might give an auditory description of the card and its coordinates on the screen.

&nbsp;&nbsp; **The distractions.** Our application features both auditory and visual distractions, both in the second round of the game. The auditory distractions - notification sounds, construction work sounds, etc - are inaccessible for deaf or hearing-impaired individuals. However, the visual distractions present in the second round - the news headlines pulled from the API - do not require the user to have any particular level of hearing. Similarly, though the visual distractions may be inaccessible for blind or visually-impaired individuals, if such individuals are not also hearing-impaired then the auditory distractions will be accessible to them.
