## End User Testing *DistractAbility* ##

### Research Objectives ###

During the initial prototyping stages our research objectives were as follows:

*    What sorts of things do people instinctively find most distracting 
*    What sorts of mind-games people would find engaging
*    Evaluate proposed user experience (flow and UI design)

Towards the end of the development phase our research objectives were as follows:

*    Test our hypothesis that the presence of distractions negatively impacts performance 
*    Test our hypothesis that DistractAbility does effectively highlight the serious problem
*    Evaluate distractions used in the second round
*    Evaluate user experience 
*    Feedback on potential future improvements 


### Methodology ###

*    Two rounds of survey testing
*    One round of moderated user testing

### Ethnography ### 




### Survey 1: Testing the initial prototype ###

View the initial prototype [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/tree/dev/Source/01-Paper-prototype/paper-prototype.pdf). View the survey questions [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/tree/dev/Report/03-UX-Design/FirstSurvey/SurveyRound1_Questions.pdf).

**Timeline**
*    Participants were sent the prototype and a summary of our project brief and asked to go over both before the group zoom call. 
*   24 hours after being sent the prototype, the researcher held a group zoom call with a subset of study participants. During the zoom call, the researcher walked everyone through the prototype, answering questions as they came up.
*    Immediately after the zoom call, participants were sent the questionnaire and asked to respond without consulting other participants in the group.

### Survey 2: Testing hypotheses and evaluating final product ###

View the survey questions [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/tree/dev/Report/03-UX-Design/SecondSurvey/SurveyRound2_Questions.pdf).

**Timeline**

* Most participants in this group were sent the survey and then left alone in a room with *DistractAbility* open on the researcher's PC. They were asked to make their way through the application and then respond to the survey in one sitting.
* A small subset of participants did not have first hand experience of engaging with *DistractAbility*. Instead, they were asked to complete the survey to the best of their ability after watching our demo video.

### Summary ### 














## Wireframes/Interaction Flow Diagrams
For the project, our initial idea involved creating a single page web application centred around making sustainable fashion choices. For the paper prototype, we used collaborative image software to test the feasibility and look of our idea. Although ideally we would have liked to do this using a traditional pen and paper approach, due to covid restrictions this was not possible. The results of this can be seen below.

Further along on the project, we decided as a group that it would be better to implement our second idea, the distraction game. Therefore, we created another prototype using adobe XD. The software, along with allowing us to create a protype, also allowed us to implement interactions between the different elements. The wireframe created involved a login page, two rounds of the card game we were planning to implement and also two charts at the end to display the users score, along with that of all other users of the games score.
For the design, as a group we tried to focus on several key elements, namely:
- Creating a circular user experience, where they are able to replay the game
- Keeping the design 'barebones' in order to allow for greater feature implementation at a later date
- Making the purpose of the game clear

The creation of this wireframe also allowed us to gather some early feedback from users, which further aided us in implemting a user centric methodology. Some of the key feedback included:
- Use advanced sounds, such as WhatsApp and Facebook notifications for the auditory distraction element.
- Use adanced animations, such as a spinning news article for the visual distraction element.
- Use background sounds as well, for example construction or a baby crying to further engage the user.
- Use logic and maths based games
- Keep the games fairly simple to allow for a wider audience access.
- Explain the benefits of user distraction.

The wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/tree/dev/Source/01-Paper-prototype "Paper Prototype Folder").
