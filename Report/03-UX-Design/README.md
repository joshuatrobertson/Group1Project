For the project, our initial idea involved creating a single page web application centred around making sustainable fashion choices. For the paper prototype, we used collaborative image software to test the feasibility and look of our idea. Although ideally we would have liked to do this using a traditional pen and paper approach, due to covid restrictions this was not possible. The results of this can be seen below.

Further along on the project, we decided as a group that it would be better to implement our second idea, the distraction game. Therefore, we created another prototype using adobe XD. The software, along with allowing us to create a protype, also allowed us to implement interactions between the different elements. The wireframe created involved a login page, two rounds of the card game we were planning to implement and also two charts at the end to display the users score, along with that of all other users of the games score.
For the design, as a group we tried to focus on several key elements, namely:
- Creating a circular user experience, where they are able to replay the game
- Keeping the design 'barebones' in order to allow for greater feature implementation at a later date
- Making the purpose of the game clear

The creation of this wireframe also allowed us to gather some early feedback from users, which further aided us in implemting a user centric methodology. Some of the key feedback included:
- Use advanced sounds, such as WhatsApp and Facebook notifications for the auditory distraction element.
- Use adanced animations, such as a spinning news article for the visual distraction element.
- Use background sounds as well, for example construction or a baby crying to further engage the user.
- Use logic and maths based games
- Keep the games fairly simple to allow for a wider audience access.
- Explain the benefits of user distraction.

The wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/Group1Project/tree/dev/Source/01-Paper-prototype "Paper Prototype Folder").
