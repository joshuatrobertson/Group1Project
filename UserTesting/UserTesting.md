# End User Testing

## Round 1 of end user testing


### The Process

- End user test participants were selected 
- Members of our group individually held Zoom calls with end user test participants. We used these calls to walk test participants through our prototype, answering questions along the way. After the walk-through a Google Survey was sent to all test participants [see 'EndUserSurvey_(1).pdf']. 
- By Tuesday, 23/03/21 thirteen end user test participants had responded to our survey. 


### The (Preliminary) Results

- For written responses to the survey please see 'SurveryWrittenResponses_1.xlsm'.



###Â Plans for further end user testing

As of Tuesday, 23/03/21 we have discussed the responses. We plan to rework the prototype based on the responses from our test participants, and then conduct a second round of end user testing.
