# Introduction
## Abstract
In this project, we propose **DistractAbility**, a single page application where the user plays two rounds of a simple brain training task, each within a time limit of two minutes. The first round is played without distraction while the second round is permeated with increasing levels of distracting stimuli, making it harder to successfully complete the task. This is meant to represent the difficulties people have experienced in staying focused during lockdown, and some of the negative implications of impaired attentional ability, for instance on people's quality of work or study.

- 'UserTesting.md' documents the end user testing process and explains the structure of the UserTesting directory.
- 'EndUserSurvey_(1).pdf' is the survey that was sent out to end user testing participants during the first round of end user testing.
- 'SurveryWrittenResponses_1.xlsm' is a record of test participants' individual, written responses to the survey questions.

# Project Idea

## 1. Sustainadress (*provisional name*) 

In the project we propose Sustainadress, a single page application where the user is tasked with finding the most sustainable outfit of the options provided, sticking within time and budget constraints. This is meant to highlight the environmental impact of fast and unsustainable fashion. We task the user with dressing themselves out of the clothing options provided; after the time limit is up, we reveal whether the user chose the most sustainable outfit overall, out of the options provided. The playful element of this project comes in customizing and dressing up your avatar, and to get a better score on the next playthrough.   

## 3. User stories

- As a user I want to click on new game to  be able to start and play a new game
- As a user I want to click on information so that I can find out about the reasoning for the project
- As a user I want to be able to see the landing page for the website
- As a user I want to be able to see the history of my recent games
- As a user I want to be able to measure the difference in scores between the distraction and non-distraction versions of the game
- As a user I want to be able to compare my scores against past users of the game

## paper_prototype 

- 'old_idea/project 1.pptx' is the prototype we created for our initial idea (Sustainadress).
- 'paper_prorotype.xd' is the prototype for our current idea (Focus on Lock).
- 'prototype_document.docx' is documentation for the current prototype and the thought process behind it.
