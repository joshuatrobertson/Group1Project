# Project Idea




## 1. Sustainadress (*provisional name*) 

In the project we propose Sustainadress, a single page application where the user is tasked with finding the most sustainable outfit of the options provided, sticking within time and budget constraints. This is meant to highlight the environmental impact of fast and unsustainable fashion. We task the user with dressing themselves out of the clothing options provided; after the time limit is up, we reveal whether the user chose the most sustainable outfit overall, out of the options provided. The playful element of this project comes in customizing and dressing up your avatar, and to get a better score on the next playthrough.   

## 2. Memory tests/Continuous tasks (*provisional name*) 

In the project we propose (placeholder), a single page application where the user can choose between many simple brain training tasks. These games are then subjected to increasing levels of distracting stimuli, making it harder to successfully complete these. This is meant to represent the difficulty of staying focused during lockdown.
